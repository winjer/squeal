"""

Simple event forwarding system. Events are represented with python objects
that implement interfaces. For example:

> class IFooEvent(Interface): pass
> class IBarEvent(Interface): pass
>
> class MyEvent(object):
>     implements(IFooEvent, IBarEvent)
>
>     def __init__(self, x, y):
>     self.x = x
>     self.y = y

The object can provide whatever methods or attributes are required.

Subscribers specify which events they wish to received based on the interfaces
implemented by the events.

Additional interfaces can be added to an event as needed at the time it is fired.

Sending events
==============

> event = MyEvent(10, "foo")
> evr = self.store.findFirst(EventReactor)
> evr.fireEvent(event, IBazEvent)

Subscribing to and receiving events
=====================

> class Thing(Item, Service):
>
>     def activate(self):
>         evr = self.store.findFirst(EventReactor)
>         evr.subscribe(self.handleFooEvent, IFooEvent)
>
>     def handleFooEvent(self, ev):
>         x = ev.x
